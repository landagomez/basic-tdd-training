# Basic TDD Training

This is a very simple example to make an exercise on how to work with TDD.

You should start running all the tests in the test folder source. You will get a fail for all of them, then you should go test by test doing a simple change to make the each test to pass.

The se are the three steps to follow to comply with the TDD approach:

 1. Write a failing test 
 2. Write the simplest bit of code that makes it pass
 3. Refactor the code to follow the rules of simple design

**NOTE:** With the code example provided you should not work on the first step, the failing tests are already in the source code.
